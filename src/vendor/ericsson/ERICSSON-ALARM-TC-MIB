        DESCRIPTION
                "A unique identification of the fault, not
                including the managed object.  Alarm types are
                used to identify if alarms indicate the same
                problem or not, for lookup into external alarm
                documentation, etc.  A unique alarm type is
                identified using the combination of two instances
                of EriAlarmType. Different managed object
                types and instances can share alarm types.  But
                if the same managed object reports the same alarm
                type, it is to be considered to be the same alarm
                state. The alarm type is a simplification of the
                different X.733 and 3GPP alarm IRP alarm
                correlation mechanisms based on EventType,
                ProbableCause, SpecificProblem and
                NotificationId."

                of the entry; for example renumbering entries is
                not allowed when entries are deleted.
                Renumbering after an agent restart is allowed.
                Note that this index shall not be used to
                identify alarms when performing
                resynchronization, etc. The logical identity for

                         This is needed for deployments where the Source IP Address

                         unknown(0)  An unknown identifier type. This value MUST
                                                 be used if the value of the corresponding

                         ipv4(1)     An IPv4 address as defined by the

                         Each definition of a concrete EriAlarmSourceIdentifierType 
                         value must be accompanied by a definition of a textual 
                         convention for use with that EriAlarmSourceIdentifierType.

                         To support future extensions, the EriAlarmSourceIdentifierType 
                         Textual convention SHOULD NOT be sub-typed in object type 
                         definitions. It MAY be sub-typed in compliance statements in 
                         order to require only a subset of these address types for a 
                         compliant implementation.

                         Implementations must ensure that EriAlarmSourceIdentifierType 
                         objects and any dependent objects (e.g. EriAlarmSourceIdentifier 
                         objects) are consistent. An inconsistentValue error must be 
                         generated if an attempt to change an EriAlarmSourceIdentifierType
                         object would, for example, lead to an undefined 
                         EriAlarmSourceIdentifier value.  In particular, 
                         EriAlarmSourceIdentifierType/EriAlarmSourceIdentifier pairs must 
                         be changed together if the address type changes (e.g. from
                         ipv6(2) to ipv4(1)).
                         
                         If extending the allowed values, it may be advisable to maintain
                         consistency with the values for InetAddressType in the
